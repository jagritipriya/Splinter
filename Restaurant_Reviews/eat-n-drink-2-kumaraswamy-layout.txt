3.0<>Menu is pretty basic. Service is pretty good. Every Christite's quick bite spot. Menu can be improved. But the pricing is perfect when taking the target customer group into consideration.4.0<>i had actually forgotten how much i love this place. Its by no means 'the best', but when youre in the mood to grab a quick bite, you couldnt find a better place. Theyre quick and the variety is amazing. There is limited seating and its almost always crowded. the food and seating all resemble a cafeteria feel.3.0<>Limited seating, but never empty. Located just near the back gate of Christ university,it's always filled with Christite. As a Christite, this is a perfect place to grab a bite when you are in a hurry. Their bun omlette is a must try. The variety of wraps and sandwiches are also good. I would recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood to snack.
