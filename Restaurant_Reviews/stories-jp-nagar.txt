4.0<>Yet another happening place in JP Nagar. Comparatively small. The Cocktail that's made from Tender Coconut is üî•.  Food - 4/5 Drinks - 5/5 Service - 4/5 Ambience - 4/5  Must Try: Cheese Fries and Cocktails.4.0<>Great ambience. Delicious food and slow service. Worth taking Zomato gold. Ordered farm fresh pizza, Alfredo pasta, cheese crackers, loaded fries and BBQ chicken. Pizza was thin crust, had enough toppings. Loaded fries was loaded corn, cheese. What amazed me was cheese crackers. It's just Monaco biscuits topped with cheese, yogurt and olives but it tasted so good. It's a must try here. Alfredo pasta lacked veggies. Service was very slow. We had to remind them again and again to serve us.4.0<>An adhoc lunch plan with my wife after a long drive through silk board on a Saturday afternoon. After all the drive it was definitely a worth while visiting the place. We were never let down as the food was just too good. We ordered Paneer in hot garlic sauce, Veg Primavera penne pasta, and Farm fresh pizza. The paneer starter was cooked to perfection. The paneer was just so soft and just melted in mouth. The flavours were just so right. Loved the dish. The pizza being thin crust wood fire pizza was so light and good. The mixed sauce pasta was served with a couple of plain breads and was just nice to end the meal. The service was good and the staff were hospitable. The ambiance was ok. Overall a great place to hangout with friends.  Food: 5/5 Service: 5/5 Ambiance: 3.5/54.0<>Made me forget that it was jp nagar! Cosy place on the 4th floor..good breeze. Friendly staff n minimum decor, nice ambience n tasty food . Loved the pesto chicken pasta n the malai fish tikka üôÇ5.0<>Geeat food and service. Sandeep was very friendly. Great experience. Lobed the pasta, melted cheese a d naughty nutty mix. Loved everything.1.0<>Giving this rating purely based on manager's attitude and the lady who is in charge of taking reservation. At the entrance we were told, that their system did not receive a confirmation, even when we had a zomato SMS. But the worst part was when I asked them to Move me to a table which was reserved for last 1 hour and no one came. The lady told me in rude. Way that the table is booked. Not sure why a resteraunt will keep a vacant table for 1 hour and tag it reserve even when I asked that the current table is not comfortable at all. The manager said give me 2 mins but never came back to our table.  Honestly my Lunch got ruined bcoz of this. Bad service and attitude is far more a bad experience than an okay meal.  Not happy with your service.  Not coming back.  Attaching a picture of the reserved table which was reserved from 2.15 pm to 3.45pm. Amazing.  You can reach me at 9711048230 for more details.  Please avoid the place on weekends. Food is decent.5.0<>Truly amazed and delighted with their food and service what ever we had ordered it was tasty n filling ! No complains just go enjoy the food and the Ambience üëåüòç  Do miss to try Sunny side pizza and chicken ham n salami Toasties üëåüëåüëå5.0<>We happen to visit this place on a weekend.

Chees items are crazy ü§™...5.0<>Stories !!! JP Nagars best resto !!! Great ambiance and top notch food. Finger licking delicious !!! Great bunch of people dedicated to making your experience an excellent one.4.0<>Stories is located at JP Nagar just opposite to Cakewala On the 4th floor ... They have 2 rooftops, the place is small but cosy with quirky decor with lush greens on the walls. Dim lights in the evening, with high tables and sofa setups in the corner with the city view. Perfect place for family dinner and groupies. Where one rooftop has a smoking area, The other one without smoking zone helps to the family to have a proper fine dine with wine or their signature cocktails, and many more I suggest:- #Stories Special (mocktail)-- orange and passion fruit juice mix with the best presentation made my day #Chatpata paneer pizza -- thin crust, topped with paneer cubes onion slices with less cheese and sweet corn in between tastes luscious. #cheese cracker canapes -- an appetizer, cracker topped with grated cheese, ketchup and curd tasted well... #corn of the Cobb -- halved sweet corn, perfectly cooked in milk and butter, served with a hint of spice topped with mayo, was really unique and the best for ur appetite #super spicy peri peri wings-- chicken wings Served well with dim sum style. It was spicy hot wit peri peri masala For spice lovers from the chef special. Main course Chicken biriyani - served in matka bowl, on the wooden pan kept it hot even after 15 min. If u have a spicy palate, this is the place for you. Their chicken biryani in basmati rice with perfectly cooked and mixed with their masala. Which makes you lick your fingers. They blend the flavours perfectly in every dish they serve. This casual fine wine dining is worth the hype it enjoys  #Ambience -4/5. #Food -4.5/5. #service -4.5/5. #parking - yes. #occupancy - 80-100 folks3.0<>I really like the Rajajinagar one, because it's bigger, better and spacious. Jp nagar one Is too congested, crowded and doesn't give out a rooftop feels. The food is pretty average, we mostly ordered appetizers, nachos and fries. The music was too loud for people to have a normal conversation and the service was slow. It's in a very good location though, I hope they upgraded their quality.3.5<>Nice ambience , good music , big screen for sports lovers . Bira is all that you will get in beer , they have other brands on menu but is never available.Food is reasonably priced , decent in taste and good presentation. Ideal for weekend chilling.3.0<>I was going to rate this place a 5 star. But they ruined it during the billing. I ordered butter garlic prawns for starters, yumm yummm yummmm! One person can easily finish it, if you‚Äôre a prawn lover. Ordered a Ferraro rocher shake, 4 on 5. Really good. And a veggie delight pizza for main course, again a 5 on 5. But all of this didn‚Äôt matter when it came to the billing. I used my zomato gold, 1+1 on food. In the bill, they didn‚Äôt reduce it. Mistakes do happen I know, but the first thing in the bill was something 2. And then 0, i felt it was a bit misleading, like in a way to show that zomato gold had been applied. But as you can see in the bill it hasn‚Äôt. And they said we must pay the GST for the discounted product. I have been using gold for a lot of months now, never faced this situation. And I felt this was very unprofessional of them to write down the final bill by pen. They should‚Äôve printed it. Food and ambience is a 4. But please do check your bill properly.4.0<>It‚Äôs a really good place to hangout. Cocktails and food is great. Especially the veg Biryani is too good. Gets too crowded so seating is sometimes a compromise... otherwise it‚Äôs a great place.4.0<>Located in JP Nagar there's a great place that goes by the name Stories. The place is lively and has some great atmosphere. It has pretty good menu in terms of variety, from Italian to Indian, from pizzas to pastas. We ordered, # Death by chocolate cake - it was very good but it was chocolate brownie not death by chocolate. # Angels Eggs - which actually were deviled eggs # Sizzler - Everything on that Sizzler was just lip smacking except it wasn't really a Sizzler, food was kinda cold for a Sizzler. Taste wise, just really good.  So here's the deal, whatever was served wasn't exactly what was told or written but tasted really really good,  My report card Price ‚Äì 7/10 Taste ‚Äì 8/10 Portion size - 6/10 Service ‚Äì 5/10 Ambiance ‚Äì 7/10 Cleanliness - 7/10 Value for money ‚Äì 7/10 Will I go back ‚Äì Absolutely4.0<>The staffs need to be more co-operative, over all the food quality is good. The best part about the place is that they are open till 1 on a week day too.3.0<>Service is tooo slow in here and not pocket friendly too üòë food taste is upto the mark not worth for the money ambience is okay üòêüôÑüôÑ only starters are good enough better then the main course4.0<>My first visit in here .. but I had been to its brother hood Dr.sheesha earlier. First thing I wanna right about is pasta ... It was so cheesy and mouth watering. We had also ordered the baby corn chilli where it was bit oily. . but the tatse was good. And then comes the fish n prawns skewers it was not much spiced or not that tasty please make it in a way that consumer must also experience the taste of spices along with the meat.4.0<>The food is amazing ‚ù§ really loved the place !it is not that big as rajajinagar's stories but thats ok!
